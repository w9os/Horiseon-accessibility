# Optimizing Horiseon for Accessibility 

In this project, the codebase of **Horiseon** is optmized to follow accessibility standards for search engine optimization. Proper semantic HTML elements were added to further improve the page's accessibility. In the *css* file, class selectors and id selectors were grouped together to condense the code.

## Semantice HTML elements

Previously the code consisted of mostly  `<div>` elements. After closely analyizing the HTML file, I was able to rename the elements with proper semantic HTML tags. Doing this helps the reader distinguish the different sections that make up the page
